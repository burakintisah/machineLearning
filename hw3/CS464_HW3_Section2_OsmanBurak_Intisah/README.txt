I have done my homework in python language. 

To be able to read the given datas you need to change the root variable in the code, 
to the path of the directory where all data files include.

Since I have done my homework you may not be able to run this notebook page if you will not delete importing drive components.
(I did not have time to arrange a notebook file which runs in the terminal sorry for that)

NOTE 1:
While doing this homework I have used google colab. If you want to check it from the I am providing the link 
for my homework.
