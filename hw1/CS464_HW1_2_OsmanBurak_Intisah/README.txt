I have done my homework in python language. 

To be able to read the given datas you need to change the root variable in the code, 
to the path of the directory where all 3 data files include.


Terminal Command:

After changing the root variable, if python 3 is loaded in your system you can go to your terminal 
and going under the directory of the files,
and type, 
	
		python q3main.py

Then corresponding plots and outputs will appear. 

If you dont have python 3 you can download anaconda 3. And do the steps that are explained above 
in anaconda prompt window.


Default Values:


How to read outputs:

The outputs provided with the labels in front of them. They are indicating the corresponding questions. 

NOTE 1:
There is a warning at the end. Which says casting complext values to real discards the imaginary part
  return array(a, dtype, copy=False, order=order)

It is because python discards the imaginary part while converting complex numbers to float.
It does not change my output. So there is not any problem about this warning.


NOTE 2:
While doing this homework I have used google colab. If you want to check it from the I am providing the link 
for my homework.
